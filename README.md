How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

"Organizing the project requirements around specific users and their needs puts more focus on really understanding the value that the project provides and who the recipient of that value is. To facilitate that process, it is useful to identify user personas as specifically as possible so that the project team can target their development efforts at the needs of those specific users. A user persona could be a specific category of user or it could even be a specific user, but in either case, it is useful to model that user’s personality and specific interests as a hypothetical user persona. A user persona helps the team visualize that user and focus its efforts around the user’s needs" (Cobb, 2015, p. 65).

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

"For an effective attainment of project goals at a defined finishing point in time, we need the linear processes and Cartesian causality and the Newtonian logic from Traditional project management. But evolutionary and self-organizational-based management methods are necessary to master complex and uncertain situations on the way to the defined finishing point in time for a project. A well-balanced interaction of traditional project management and the evolutionary and self-organizational principles is the message of the Project Management Second Order" (Cobb, 2015, p. 11).

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member, in software development, means that you enhances agility by having continuous attention to technical excellence and good design (Cobb, 2015, p. 29).
